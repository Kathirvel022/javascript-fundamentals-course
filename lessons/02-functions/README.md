## 🤝 Getting Help

### Common Questions
1. **Q**: What's the difference between a parameter and an argument?
   **A**: A parameter is the variable in the function definition, an argument is the value passed when calling the function.

2. **Q**: When should I use arrow functions?
   **A**: Arrow functions are great for short, simple functions, especially in callbacks and array methods.

3. **Q**: What is function scope?
   **A**: Function scope means variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function.
