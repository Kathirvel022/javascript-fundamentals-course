**Example for Arrays:**
"Think of an array like a numbered list or a row of boxes. Each box has a number (index) and contains something (value)."

### 2. Use Visual Aids
- Draw arrays on whiteboard
- Show array operations visually
- Use color coding for different elements

### 3. Progressive Complexity
- Start with simple arrays
- Build to complex operations
- Ensure understanding before moving on

### 4. Hands-On Practice
- Students code along with examples
