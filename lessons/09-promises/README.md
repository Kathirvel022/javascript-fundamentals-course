## 🎯 Learning Path

### Step 1: Promise Basics
Start with `lesson-1-promise-basics.js` to learn:
- What are Promises and why they exist
- Promise states and lifecycle
- Creating Promises with resolve and reject
- Basic Promise handling

### Step 2: Promise Methods
Continue with `lesson-2-promise-methods.js` to learn:
- .then() and .catch() methods
- .finally() method
- Promise chaining
- Method chaining patterns

### Step 3: Async/Await
Learn with `lesson-3-async-await.js`:
- Async function syntax
- Await keyword usage
- Error handling with try/catch
- Converting between Promises and async/await

### Step 4: Error Handling
Study `lesson-4-error-handling.js`:
- Promise rejection handling
- Error propagation in chains
- Try/catch with async/await
- Best practices for error handling

### Step 5: Promise Utilities
Explore `lesson-5-promise-utilities.js`:
- Promise.all() for parallel execution
- Promise.race() for first completion
- Promise.allSettled() for all results
- Promise.any() for first success

### Step 6: Real-World Applications
Master `lesson-6-real-world-apps.js`:
- API calls and data fetching
- File operations
- Database operations
- User interface updates

### Step 7: Promise Optimization
Finish with `lesson-7-promise-optimization.js`:
- Performance considerations
- Memory management
- Best practices
- Common mistakes and solutions

## 🤝 Getting Help

### Common Questions
1. **Q**: What's the difference between .then() and async/await?
   **A**: .then() is Promise method chaining, async/await is syntactic sugar that makes async code look synchronous.

2. **Q**: When should I use Promise.all() vs Promise.race()?
   **A**: Use Promise.all() when you need all results, Promise.race() when you only need the first one.

3. **Q**: How do I handle errors in async/await?
   **A**: Use try/catch blocks around your await statements.
