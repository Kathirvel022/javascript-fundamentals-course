## üìä Assessment Strategy

### Formative Assessment (During Learning)
- **Exit Tickets**: Quick questions at end of each lesson
- **Code Reviews**: Check student code during practice
- **Peer Review**: Students review each other's loops
- **Quick Checks**: Spot checks during exercises

### Summative Assessment (End of Module)
- **Exercises**: 40% of grade
- **Assignments**: 40% of grade
- **Final Project**: 20% of grade

## üéØ Teaching Strategies

### 1. Start with Real-World Examples
- Use analogies students can relate to
- Show practical applications
- Connect concepts to everyday life

**Example for Loops:**
"Think of a loop like a conveyor belt in a factory. It keeps moving items through the same process over and over again."

### 2. Use Interactive Coding
- Code live in class
- Have students follow along
- Encourage questions and experimentation

### 3. Gradual Complexity
- Start with simple examples
- Build complexity gradually
- Ensure understanding before moving on

### 4. Visual Aids
- Draw loop flowcharts
- Show data flow diagrams
- Use animations when possible

## üìù Lesson Materials

### Code Examples
Each lesson includes:
- Working code demonstrations
- Step-by-step explanations
- Multiple examples for each concept
- Practical applications

### Practice Exercises
- Guided practice problems
- Individual coding challenges
- Pair programming activities
- Group problem-solving

### Assessment Materials
- Exercise solutions
- Grading rubrics
- Sample student work
- Common mistake examples

## üö® Common Student Issues

### Issue: Infinite Loops
**Solution**: 
- Always ensure loop condition changes
- Use break statements carefully
- Test with small datasets first

### Issue: Off-by-One Errors
**Solution**:
- Pay attention to array indices
