## 🎯 Learning Path

### Step 1: Basic Loops
Start with `lesson-1-for-loops.js` to learn:
- For loops and while loops
- Loop syntax and structure
- Basic iteration patterns

### Step 2: Modern Loops
Continue with `lesson-2-for-of-loops.js` to learn:
- For...of loops for arrays
- For...in loops for objects
- When to use each type

### Step 3: Array Methods
Learn with `lesson-3-array-methods.js`:
- forEach for iteration
- map for transformation
- filter for selection
- reduce for aggregation

### Step 4: Advanced Patterns
Study `lesson-4-nested-loops.js`:
- Nested loops
- Complex iteration patterns
- Multi-dimensional arrays

### Step 5: Optimization
Finish with `lesson-5-optimization.js`:
- Loop performance
- Best practices
- Common mistakes to avoid

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🤝 Getting Help

### Common Questions
1. **Q**: When should I use for...of vs for...in?
   **A**: Use for...of for arrays, for...in for objects.

2. **Q**: What's the difference between map and forEach?
   **A**: map returns a new array, forEach doesn't return anything.

3. **Q**: How do I break out of a nested loop?
   **A**: Use labels or return from a function.
