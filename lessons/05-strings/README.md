## 🤝 Getting Help

### Common Questions
1. **Q**: When should I use template literals vs concatenation?
   **A**: Use template literals for complex strings, concatenation for simple cases.

2. **Q**: What's the difference between indexOf and includes?
   **A**: indexOf returns position (-1 if not found), includes returns true/false.

3. **Q**: How do I validate email addresses?
   **A**: Use regular expressions or built-in validation methods.
