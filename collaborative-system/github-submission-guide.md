## ðŸŽ“ Teacher Workflow

2. **Review the code** and provide feedback
3. **Merge or request changes**
4. **Update student progress** in tracking system

### Managing Student Folders:
```bash
# Each student gets their own folder
student-work/
â”œâ”€â”€ student-001-john-doe/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exercises/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01-basics/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 02-functions/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assignments/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ progress.md
â”œâ”€â”€ student-002-jane-smith/
â””â”€â”€ student-003-bob-wilson/
```

## ðŸ”§ GitHub Repository Setup

### 1. Create Issue Templates
Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` folder with:

#### `exercise-submission.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Exercise Submission
about: Submit a completed exercise
title: "[EXERCISE] Student XXX - Exercise Name"
labels: exercise, submission
assignees: teacher-username
---

## Student Information
- **Student ID**: 
- **Name**: 
- **Exercise**: 
- **Module**: 

## Submission Details
- **Files Submitted**: 
- **Completion Status**: 
- **Notes**: 

## Code
```javascript
// Paste your code here
```
```

#### `assignment-submission.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Assignment Submission
about: Submit a completed assignment
title: "[ASSIGNMENT] Student XXX - Assignment Name"
labels: assignment, submission
assignees: teacher-username
---

## Student Information
- **Student ID**: 
- **Name**: 
- **Assignment**: 
- **Module**: 

## Submission Details
- **Files Submitted**: 
- **Completion Status**: 
- **Notes**: 

## Code
```javascript
// Paste your code here
```
```

### 2. Create Pull Request Templates
Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
```markdown
## Submission Details
- **Student ID**: 
- **Name**: 
- **Type**: [Exercise/Assignment/Project]
- **Module**: 
- **Files**: 

## Description
Brief description of what you've submitted.

## Checklist

- [ ] Code is properly commented
- [ ] All files are included
- [ ] Ready for review
```

### 3. Set Up Branch Protection
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to "Branches"
3. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks
   - Restrict pushes to main branch

## ðŸ“Š Automated Workflow

### GitHub Actions for Auto-Grading
Create `.github/workflows/auto-grade.yml`:
```yaml
name: Auto-Grade Submissions

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'student-work/**'

jobs:
  grade:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - name: Run Auto-Grader
        run: |
          cd collaborative-system
          node auto-grader.js ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
      - name: Comment Results
        uses: actions/github-script@v3
        with:
          script: |
            // Post grading results as PR comment
```
